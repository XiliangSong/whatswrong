#summary How to use the generic format.

= Introduction =

whatswrong provides a generic format that you can use to visualize data even if it is not
in one of the existing formats. 


= Format =

Let us start by an example:
{{{
>>
>Word
0 "The"
1 "man"
2 "likes"
3 "football"
4 "."

>Mentions
0  1  "Person"
3  3  "Concept"

>Relations
2  1  "Agent"
2  3  "Theme"

>>
...
}}}
This file defines a sentence start using `>>`. Then it defines a token property `Word` that will result in 
tokens with words in the visualizer. Next we define a span property `Mentions` that will yield labelled spans in the visualizer. Finally, we add `Relations` for a labelled edges between tokens. Then we start the next sentence (or visualization unit) with `>>`.

Note that how these token and span/edge properties are visualized is actually *up to you*. That is, when you load a file in _thebeast_ format you can decide which of these properties should be _span_ properties, which _token_ and which _edge_ properties.
